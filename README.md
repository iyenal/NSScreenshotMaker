## NSScreenshotMaker, with added PDF planned support

Based on NSScreenshotMaker, by cheuble (gbatemp.net/members/cheuble.382638/) ;)
I didn't started yet, but the support I will implement will be pretty straightforward just to provide a basic state of functionnality, time is valuable. If I will even time to do so or just be lazy and still read on a trivial tablet. But I will have first to see how I can "clean" the code to be more convenient to work with, I really don't appreciate Python.

*Seriously just search "Python memes" and find how much there are compared to other languages...*
Probably making a frontend in C#/dotNet Core cause we know that it is definitively the future... and UWP will make converting books to Switch even possible on your mobile.

## Why?
Reading books like "Only The Paranoid Survive" by Andy Grove would be a great thing to do, so let's make that. This book is so good that it deserves it, you should really take some time and read what our Man of the Year 1997 wrote us. A shame that today it became so rare that I had to see the book at the BnF (Biblioth√®que nationale de France).
I need also to finish "The Hard Thing About Hard Things: Building a Business When There Are No Easy Answers", I think I read half so far.
Well now you have a collection of book to read when the PDF support will be (hopefully) added.
